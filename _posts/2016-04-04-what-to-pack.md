# What to Pack

Taking the time to pack carefully can make a difference to how much you enjoy your retreat.

We recommend packing into smaller bags, baskets or crates, so that each one holds the goods for a specific part of your retreat.  For example, if part of your retreat is to get back on track with your blog, then you might have a basket/bag with the following items:

* Laptop
* Charger
* Notebook/Journal
* Pencil case
* Camera
* Camera charger

Another basket could be the items for the kitchen bench, namely:

* Your favourite tea/coffee
* Any sweeteners you use (remember sugar or artificial are usually the only ones provided)
* A favourite big mug or special teacup
* A decent sharp knife (not if you're flying in though!)
